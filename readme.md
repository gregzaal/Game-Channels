# Game Channels

Add this bot to your server using: `https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=514906379660689428&scope=bot&permissions=8`

Automatically creates a text channel for each game that your users play, and gives them permissions to see it when they play that game. This way people only see the channels for the games they play and don't get spammed with chat they don't care about.


## Installation

Requires:

* Python 3.5+
* Discord.py rewrite version (install with `pip install -U git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py@rewrite#egg=discord.py`)

It's recommended to first create a virtual environment before installing discord.py: `python3 -m virtualenv bot-env`

## Usage

This bot is still WIP, so documenting it now would be pointless. Just read through the code to see what commands can be used.
